The HPT stage 2 disk failed because of low-cycle fatigue cracks that initiated from an internal subsurface manufacturing anomaly that was most likely not detectable during production inspections and subsequent in service inspections using the procedures in place. Contributing to the serious passenger injury was (1) the delay in shutting down the left engine and (2) a flight attendant's deviation from company procedures, which resulted in passengers evacuating from the left overwing exit while the left engine was still operating.

The progressive failure of the low pressure rotor caused an increasingly imbalanced load that eventually resulted in the fracture of the oil supply tube that allowed oil to contact hot engine parts and smolder and ignite resulting in the undercowl fire.",2021,Boeing 767
